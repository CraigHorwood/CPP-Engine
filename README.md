# CPP-Engine

This is a C++ game engine I am currently working on as a demonstration of my experience with the C++ programming language, OpenGL, shader programming, physics systems, and eventually audio programming and GPU acceleration. In its current unfinished state, the engine only uses GLFW to create an OpenGL rendering context and GLEW for OpenGL extensions.

In the bin folder, I have included a working build of the engine's test application, as well as a generic batch file to be filled in with appropriate directories which will compile the test application with G++.
